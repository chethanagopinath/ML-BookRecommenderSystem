## Book Recommender System 
- Developed a **recommendation system** using **Python** by performing data extraction from a books dataset, dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis**(PCA) and Collaborative Filtering using **KMeans** clustering.
- Once the data is prepared, transformed into fewer dimensions and the data points are clustered using KMeans, the user is recommended a book based on clusters in which their previously read books are present.

The source code is in the notebook, BookRecommenderKMeans.ipynb.
